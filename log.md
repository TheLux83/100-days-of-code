# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with O'Reilly's Flask eBook and created the first template

**Thoughts:** I had read these Chapters before, but it is a good idea to restart the book, so everyone (me, too) is able to see my progress.

### Day 2: February 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Login Manager for the flasky Plugin. It was a little forward from yesterday, but I was there before starting the challenge and I thought it's not necessary for me to go through the whole thing again.

**Thoughts:** I've struggled with myself. I didn't know what to do in my 100Daysofcode Challenge. Was thinking of a blog, than a markdown wiki and than a markdown notes app. Ultimately I've decided to code that app, I have to code anyways. A cost app for our fire department. But since it will be a company app, I won't upload my progress to github. It's unfortunate, but I hope that this decission will make it easier for me to actually code the whole 100 days. I will keep track of my progress here anyways. Maybe with code snippets. :-)

### Day 3: February 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to create a user for login testing. Unfortunately something is wrong with the database. Tried to repair the issue, but there seems to be something very wrong with the whole database. Most of the time was sacrificed searching for an answer

**Thoughts:** It's really frustrating when you have an error and absolutely no idea why this error pops up. This is the downside of learning from a book. If you don't understand everything that is written, you have a bad time searching for a fix, when one occurs.

### Day 4: February 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the gettings started tutorial for Django. Finished part 2 of it. 

**Thoughts:** Since the last frustating moment with Flask, I wanted to give Django a shot to see, if it's easier to use. First I was confused of all the files and folders it creates. But my reading of the flask book helped a lot to understand what's going on here. I will definitely go through the whole tutorial and after that I will choose what framework I'm using for my fire department app.
