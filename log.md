# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started with O'Reilly's Flask eBook and created the first template

**Thoughts:** I had read these Chapters before, but it is a good idea to restart the book, so everyone (me, too) is able to see my progress.
