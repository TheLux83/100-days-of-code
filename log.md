# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with O'Reilly's Flask eBook and created the first template

**Thoughts:** I had read these Chapters before, but it is a good idea to restart the book, so everyone (me, too) is able to see my progress.

### Day 2: February 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Login Manager for the flasky Plugin. It was a little forward from yesterday, but I was there before starting the challenge and I thought it's not necessary for me to go through the whole thing again.

**Thoughts:** I've struggled with myself. I didn't know what to do in my 100Daysofcode Challenge. Was thinking of a blog, than a markdown wiki and than a markdown notes app. Ultimately I've decided to code that app, I have to code anyways. A cost app for our fire department. But since it will be a company app, I won't upload my progress to github. It's unfortunate, but I hope that this decission will make it easier for me to actually code the whole 100 days. I will keep track of my progress here anyways. Maybe with code snippets. :-)

### Day 3: February 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to create a user for login testing. Unfortunately something is wrong with the database. Tried to repair the issue, but there seems to be something very wrong with the whole database. Most of the time was sacrificed searching for an answer

**Thoughts:** It's really frustrating when you have an error and absolutely no idea why this error pops up. This is the downside of learning from a book. If you don't understand everything that is written, you have a bad time searching for a fix, when one occurs.

### Day 4: February 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the gettings started tutorial for Django. Finished part 2 of it. 

**Thoughts:** Since the last frustating moment with Flask, I wanted to give Django a shot to see, if it's easier to use. First I was confused of all the files and folders it creates. But my reading of the flask book helped a lot to understand what's going on here. I will definitely go through the whole tutorial and after that I will choose what framework I'm using for my fire department app.

### Day 5: February 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Progressed the Django tutorial and reread the previous 2 tutorial sites. Getting into models and views

**Thoughts:** I realised that Django and Flask are familiar in many steps, but different in other. I still benefit from learning Flask before jumping into django, but I have to reread the tutorial steps to really learn what I typed. This will take a bit longer, but I understand what I'm doing then ^^

### Day 6: February 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rewritten the whole Django Tutorial. First to get the commands into my brain and second because I hadn't the code on this computer.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't a bad idea to rewrite everything. I think, that the whole thing is settling in my brain. I understand more and more of that what I'm typing. I'm still aren't able to write a whole website on my own, but I hope, that at the end of this week, I will have gone through the whole tutorial and am able to start my little project.

### Day 8: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned the rest of the test chapter. Additionally learned how to use static sites and how to customize the admin page

**Thoughts:** I've finished the 'getting started' Tutorial. Now on to the real app. The Fire Department database! (Oh how I will have to read the documentation every 5 minutes because I don't know what I'm doing!)

### Day 9: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started my Firedepartment App. created the first models for VehicleTypes with normalisation. Added all vehicle types we need

**Thoughts:** Had to reread most of what I coded from the getting started tutorial. But I think that' a normal behaviour, because it's the first time I code on my own. It's very suprising and satisfying that I was able to create the first functional models in no time. Tomorrow I will create the next model. I've decided to build the backend before the front end.

### Day 10: February 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created all database models I needed. 

**Thoughts:** Haven't done much more than creating the models. But it was a good training, because I've added differen Fieldsets and learned a lot from it. The time I'll implement all models into the admin interface. After that, I don't have any excuse left and have to script the frontend.

### Day 11: February 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today is saturday and I "only" reread Python tutorials.

**Thoughts:** My code is at work and I used my saturday (and probably my sunday, too) for re-reading python tutorial to keep my mind busy and don't forget the most basic parts for my django apps

### Day 12: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Like yesterday, I re-read a Python tutorial. Read about strings, dictionaries, loops and inputs.

**Thoughts:** I already know most of these concepts, but it's refreshing to re-read these, so I don't forget how to do a for loop correctly

### Day 13: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added all models to the admin page. Read about customizing the admin page and made a doodle of the startpage

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much coding today, but I'm in the making for the frontpage. Something that I'm most afraid of, because I have to get creative about the design. And I'm not that creative. Hopefully I will get this done as soon as possible

### Day 14: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Build all pages in Gimp. The design is done.

**Thoughts:** Design isn't my best trait. But I think I did a good job. But it took the whole day. I hope that I'm able to script tomorrow again. 

### Day 15: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created my own admin page. Unfortunately this destroyed everything. Began from scratch with a new project

**Thoughts:** Like so often, my problem was, that I wanted too much. I had created an own admin page to geht my own Title and getting rid of the "Django-Administration" label. But this destroyed the server. I couldn't figure out what the problem was. So I started completely new an try to do only as much as needed.

### Day 16: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: build the first templates and created the first form

**Thoughts:** It was a tough fight, creating the forms for my project. I had everything running, when I found out, that there was an easier way to acomplish my goals. So I had to rewrite everything. After that, I had a few issues with saving images. But after all, I've learned much today and hope, that the other forms don't take that long

### Day 17: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played two Kata from CodeWars. Finished the first one, gave up on the second one

**Thoughts:** It's weekend and I found a website namend codewars. Here you have to find solutions for given questions. The first one was really easy. convert an integer to a string. The second one let's me find out, it the given number was a perfect integral square and if yes, I have to finde the next integral square. I couldn't figure out how to do this and given up on it. Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow with the next task. Yesterday was the birthday of my girlfriend, so no Challenge yesterday

### Day 18: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played a few Kata from CodeWars. Finished two, on one I gave up

**Thoughts:** My second day on CodeWars. It was fun (and easier than the last time). It's pretty cool to see the other solutions after you've submitted your own. Tomorrow I continue with my firedepartment App

### Day 19: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created all necessary forms for my firedepartment website.

**Thoughts:** Since I've created the first form last week, it wasn't that hard to create the rest. Tomorrow I'll create my base template.

### Day 20: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a base template and installed bootstrap

**Thoughts:** I've finished what I wanted to achieve today. But I'm not happy with the result. I only installed bootstrap and created half of a base template. I couldn't wrap my head around the whole template and static situation, so that I had to give up. Maybe tomorrow my head will be clearer

### Day 21: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Extendes the base.html and added bootstrap features to it

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get bootstrap running. Django didn't find the static files. I don't know why, I've done everything like in the tutorials. Maybe I'll find a solution tomorrow
