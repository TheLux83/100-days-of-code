# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with O'Reilly's Flask eBook and created the first template

**Thoughts:** I had read these Chapters before, but it is a good idea to restart the book, so everyone (me, too) is able to see my progress.

**Link to work:** [TheLux' Flasky Blog](https://github.com/TheLux83/tl_flasky)

### Day 2: February 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Login Manager for the flasky Plugin. It was a little forward from yesterday, but I was there before starting the challenge and I thought it's not necessary for me to go through the whole thing again.

**Thoughts:** I've struggled with myself. I didn't know what to do in my 100Daysofcode Challenge. Was thinking of a blog, than a markdown wiki and than a markdown notes app. Ultimately I've decided to code that app, I have to code anyways. A cost app for our fire department. But since it will be a company app, I won't upload my progress to github. It's unfortunate, but I hope that this decission will make it easier for me to actually code the whole 100 days. I will keep track of my progress here anyways. Maybe with code snippets. :-)

### Day 3: February 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to create a user for login testing. Unfortunately something is wrong with the database. Tried to repair the issue, but there seems to be something very wrong with the whole database. Most of the time was sacrificed searching for an answer

**Thoughts:** It's really frustrating when you have an error and absolutely no idea why this error pops up. This is the downside of learning from a book. If you don't understand everything that is written, you have a bad time searching for a fix, when one occurs.

### Day 4: February 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the gettings started tutorial for Django. Finished part 2 of it. 

**Thoughts:** Since the last frustating moment with Flask, I wanted to give Django a shot to see, if it's easier to use. First I was confused of all the files and folders it creates. But my reading of the flask book helped a lot to understand what's going on here. I will definitely go through the whole tutorial and after that I will choose what framework I'm using for my fire department app.

### Day 5: February 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Progressed the Django tutorial and reread the previous 2 tutorial sites. Getting into models and views

**Thoughts:** I realised that Django and Flask are familiar in many steps, but different in other. I still benefit from learning Flask before jumping into django, but I have to reread the tutorial steps to really learn what I typed. This will take a bit longer, but I understand what I'm doing then ^^

### Day 6: February 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rewritten the whole Django Tutorial. First to get the commands into my brain and second because I hadn't the code on this computer.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't a bad idea to rewrite everything. I think, that the whole thing is settling in my brain. I understand more and more of that what I'm typing. I'm still aren't able to write a whole website on my own, but I hope, that at the end of this week, I will have gone through the whole tutorial and am able to start my little project.

### Day 8: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned the rest of the test chapter. Additionally learned how to use static sites and how to customize the admin page

**Thoughts:** I've finished the 'getting started' Tutorial. Now on to the real app. The Fire Department database! (Oh how I will have to read the documentation every 5 minutes because I don't know what I'm doing!)

### Day 9: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started my Firedepartment App. created the first models for VehicleTypes with normalisation. Added all vehicle types we need

**Thoughts:** Had to reread most of what I coded from the getting started tutorial. But I think that' a normal behaviour, because it's the first time I code on my own. It's very suprising and satisfying that I was able to create the first functional models in no time. Tomorrow I will create the next model. I've decided to build the backend before the front end.

### Day 10: February 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created all database models I needed. 

**Thoughts:** Haven't done much more than creating the models. But it was a good training, because I've added differen Fieldsets and learned a lot from it. The time I'll implement all models into the admin interface. After that, I don't have any excuse left and have to script the frontend.

### Day 11: February 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today is saturday and I "only" reread Python tutorials.

**Thoughts:** My code is at work and I used my saturday (and probably my sunday, too) for re-reading python tutorial to keep my mind busy and don't forget the most basic parts for my django apps

### Day 12: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Like yesterday, I re-read a Python tutorial. Read about strings, dictionaries, loops and inputs.

**Thoughts:** I already know most of these concepts, but it's refreshing to re-read these, so I don't forget how to do a for loop correctly

### Day 13: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added all models to the admin page. Read about customizing the admin page and made a doodle of the startpage

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much coding today, but I'm in the making for the frontpage. Something that I'm most afraid of, because I have to get creative about the design. And I'm not that creative. Hopefully I will get this done as soon as possible

### Day 14: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Build all pages in Gimp. The design is done.

**Thoughts:** Design isn't my best trait. But I think I did a good job. But it took the whole day. I hope that I'm able to script tomorrow again. 

### Day 15: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created my own admin page. Unfortunately this destroyed everything. Began from scratch with a new project

**Thoughts:** Like so often, my problem was, that I wanted too much. I had created an own admin page to geht my own Title and getting rid of the "Django-Administration" label. But this destroyed the server. I couldn't figure out what the problem was. So I started completely new an try to do only as much as needed.

### Day 16: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: build the first templates and created the first form

**Thoughts:** It was a tough fight, creating the forms for my project. I had everything running, when I found out, that there was an easier way to acomplish my goals. So I had to rewrite everything. After that, I had a few issues with saving images. But after all, I've learned much today and hope, that the other forms don't take that long

### Day 17: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played two Kata from CodeWars. Finished the first one, gave up on the second one

**Thoughts:** It's weekend and I found a website namend codewars. Here you have to find solutions for given questions. The first one was really easy. convert an integer to a string. The second one let's me find out, it the given number was a perfect integral square and if yes, I have to finde the next integral square. I couldn't figure out how to do this and given up on it. Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow with the next task. Yesterday was the birthday of my girlfriend, so no Challenge yesterday

### Day 18: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played a few Kata from CodeWars. Finished two, on one I gave up

**Thoughts:** My second day on CodeWars. It was fun (and easier than the last time). It's pretty cool to see the other solutions after you've submitted your own. Tomorrow I continue with my firedepartment App

### Day 19: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created all necessary forms for my firedepartment website.

**Thoughts:** Since I've created the first form last week, it wasn't that hard to create the rest. Tomorrow I'll create my base template.

### Day 20: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a base template and installed bootstrap

**Thoughts:** I've finished what I wanted to achieve today. But I'm not happy with the result. I only installed bootstrap and created half of a base template. I couldn't wrap my head around the whole template and static situation, so that I had to give up. Maybe tomorrow my head will be clearer

### Day 21: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Extendes the base.html and added bootstrap features to it

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get bootstrap running. Django didn't find the static files. I don't know why, I've done everything like in the tutorials. Maybe I'll find a solution tomorrow

### Day 22: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Repaired the adding of bootstrap and modified the base.html a bit. Added colors and links

**Thoughts:** Dumb me forogt one letter in bootstrap.css, so that it couldn't load. After that, I was able to play with the colors and the buttons. I've added a few links, too. Not acomplished very much. But it's a bit

### Day 23: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to design my forms. First with bootstrap, then with crispy forms.

**Thoughts:** I didn't know it is complicated to create a form with bootstrap. In my defense, I've created the database models with english names and want to have them in german printed. This don't seem to be that easy. Maybe I should'nt use ModelForm and switch to Form and create the forms from scratch

### Day 24: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Trained a few codewars katas. Got 3 solutions and one that I wasn't able to solve

**Thoughts:** It's the weekend. So no coding on my Django app but train a few katas in codewars. I've solved 3 katas, which isn't that bad. I'm getting better and better :)

### Day 25: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Again, trained a few katas on codewars.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately this time I wasn't that good. I had to give up one kata, because I don't understood, what it wanted from me. I only finished one kata today.

### Day 26: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a new view for the vehicles list. Build a template for all forms.

**Thoughts:** On going through my code again, I realised, that I could combine all forms to one template and only change the heading. This saves a few edits, when I have to change something. The second thing I've done today was creating the first view for displaying all vehicles from the database

### Day 27: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to load the pictures from my database. I couldn't find the solution

**Thoughts:** Today was really frustrating. I would like to display the saved images from my database, but I wasn't able to do that. Googled the whole time and found a few ideas, but none of them really helped. I'm afraid I'm missing a few fundamental things here.

### Day 28: March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked further on getting the images shown. Got it running. Designed the template a bit further

**Thoughts:** I've got the image loading running. A Youtube video showed me what I had to do and now it works. I even had enough time today, to design the list view a bit.

### Day 29: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: read through a bootstrap tutorial, configured vim and designed the list pages

**Thoughts:** I'm still on the design part for the list page of the vehicles. But I think I've finished it. Tomorrow I will create the detail page

### Day 30: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read through a tutorial to learn detailed views. Modified my list view and started on scripting the detailed view

**Thoughts:** My list view was almost "perfect". I just had to switch from a function call to a class call in my urls.py. The details view is a little bit harder to learn. And I had not much time today. Still got my hour of coding

### Day 31: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished two Katas from CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I thought about creating a passphrase generator script, but I couldn't concentrate enough to build a new program. So I solved a few katas.

### Day 32: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a passphrase generator script to code in the weekend. Created the inital script and added loading from a txt file and generating a string with 4 words.

**Thoughts:** Today I finally started a second project, which occured to me this week. I wanted to create a (german) passphrase generator to generate better password for my colleagues. I've finished creating a 4 word long passphrase from a txt file. I'm pretty happy with the inital result.

### Day 33: March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating the detailpage for my fire trucks.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday was a bad day, so I skipped coding. But today, I was able to finished the fundamentals of the detail page of the fire trucks. 

### Day 34: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read a tutorial about Django forms

**Thoughts:** Not much done today. Only had an hour and I wanted to use this hour to read a good tutorial about forms in Django. I hope that I'll create the edit page tomorrow and maybe update the creation forms, too.

### Day 35: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created and edited my Django Forms to use the newly learned class based forms

**Thoughts:** As written yesterdaz, I found a new way to create Django Forms with class based forms from [this turorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms). Today I created these forms and edited my old forms. I learned a lot from that and now I have working forms for new elements, editing elements and deleting elements.

### Day 36: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Coded Arguments for my weekend project, my 'Passphrase Generator'.

**Thoughts:** I've searched for a way to read arguments one types into my passphrase generator and stumbled upon argparse. After reading [the tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html#id1), I've coded most of my arguments today.

### Day 37: March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Little Design work. changed the buttons from 'Anzeigen | Bearbeiten' to 'Bearbeiten | Löschen' and vertically aligned the list

**Thoughts:** Today was a short day for coding, so I designed the database a bit. Now I have german words in my forms and the user is able to delete an entry. Additionally, the list is vertically aligned to the bottom. Little, but important things.

### Day 38: March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Testing everything on the vehicle side of my database with entering real data

**Thoughts:** Today was database testing day. I've added several items into my database to see, if everything works. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with images. It seems, that they are saved in a wrong path (or not saved at all?) I have to investigate this

### Day 39: March 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a way to upload images in my form field. Tried to solve the comma problem in my DecimalFields.

**Thoughts:** The image problem wasn't that big. I just had to insert `enctype="multipart/form-data"` into my form. But I lost 1,5 hours to figure out how to use a comma instead of a point in my forms. And I didn't found any good solution. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day...

### Day 40: March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Entered data to my Database. Nothing more today

**Thoughts:** Got not much done today. But the vehicles are in the database. Next time I hope I can make the detail page look nicer
