# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with O'Reilly's Flask eBook and created the first template

**Thoughts:** I had read these Chapters before, but it is a good idea to restart the book, so everyone (me, too) is able to see my progress.

### Day 2: February 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Login Manager for the flasky Plugin. It was a little forward from yesterday, but I was there before starting the challenge and I thought it's not necessary for me to go through the whole thing again.

**Thoughts:** I've struggled with myself. I didn't know what to do in my 100Daysofcode Challenge. Was thinking of a blog, than a markdown wiki and than a markdown notes app. Ultimately I've decided to code that app, I have to code anyways. A cost app for our fire department. But since it will be a company app, I won't upload my progress to github. It's unfortunate, but I hope that this decission will make it easier for me to actually code the whole 100 days. I will keep track of my progress here anyways. Maybe with code snippets. :-)

### Day 3: February 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to create a user for login testing. Unfortunately something is wrong with the database. Tried to repair the issue, but there seems to be something very wrong with the whole database. Most of the time was sacrificed searching for an answer

**Thoughts:** It's really frustrating when you have an error and absolutely no idea why this error pops up. This is the downside of learning from a book. If you don't understand everything that is written, you have a bad time searching for a fix, when one occurs.

### Day 4: February 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the gettings started tutorial for Django. Finished part 2 of it. 

**Thoughts:** Since the last frustating moment with Flask, I wanted to give Django a shot to see, if it's easier to use. First I was confused of all the files and folders it creates. But my reading of the flask book helped a lot to understand what's going on here. I will definitely go through the whole tutorial and after that I will choose what framework I'm using for my fire department app.

### Day 5: February 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Progressed the Django tutorial and reread the previous 2 tutorial sites. Getting into models and views

**Thoughts:** I realised that Django and Flask are familiar in many steps, but different in other. I still benefit from learning Flask before jumping into django, but I have to reread the tutorial steps to really learn what I typed. This will take a bit longer, but I understand what I'm doing then ^^

### Day 6: February 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rewritten the whole Django Tutorial. First to get the commands into my brain and second because I hadn't the code on this computer.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't a bad idea to rewrite everything. I think, that the whole thing is settling in my brain. I understand more and more of that what I'm typing. I'm still aren't able to write a whole website on my own, but I hope, that at the end of this week, I will have gone through the whole tutorial and am able to start my little project.

### Day 8: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned the rest of the test chapter. Additionally learned how to use static sites and how to customize the admin page

**Thoughts:** I've finished the 'getting started' Tutorial. Now on to the real app. The Fire Department database! (Oh how I will have to read the documentation every 5 minutes because I don't know what I'm doing!)

### Day 9: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started my Firedepartment App. created the first models for VehicleTypes with normalisation. Added all vehicle types we need

**Thoughts:** Had to reread most of what I coded from the getting started tutorial. But I think that' a normal behaviour, because it's the first time I code on my own. It's very suprising and satisfying that I was able to create the first functional models in no time. Tomorrow I will create the next model. I've decided to build the backend before the front end.

### Day 10: February 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created all database models I needed. 

**Thoughts:** Haven't done much more than creating the models. But it was a good training, because I've added differen Fieldsets and learned a lot from it. The time I'll implement all models into the admin interface. After that, I don't have any excuse left and have to script the frontend.
