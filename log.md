# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with O'Reilly's Flask eBook and created the first template

**Thoughts:** I had read these Chapters before, but it is a good idea to restart the book, so everyone (me, too) is able to see my progress.

**Link to work:** [TheLux' Flasky Blog](https://github.com/TheLux83/tl_flasky)

### Day 2: February 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Login Manager for the flasky Plugin. It was a little forward from yesterday, but I was there before starting the challenge and I thought it's not necessary for me to go through the whole thing again.

**Thoughts:** I've struggled with myself. I didn't know what to do in my 100Daysofcode Challenge. Was thinking of a blog, than a markdown wiki and than a markdown notes app. Ultimately I've decided to code that app, I have to code anyways. A cost app for our fire department. But since it will be a company app, I won't upload my progress to github. It's unfortunate, but I hope that this decission will make it easier for me to actually code the whole 100 days. I will keep track of my progress here anyways. Maybe with code snippets. :-)
